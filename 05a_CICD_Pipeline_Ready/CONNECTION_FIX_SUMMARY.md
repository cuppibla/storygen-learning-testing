# StoryGen Connection Issues - Fixed ✅

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Frontend WebSocket URL Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to connect with incorrect WebSocket URL format
- Deploy script was converting `https://` to `wss://` incorrectly
- WebSocket URL construction was not handling HTTPS properly

**Fix**: 
- Updated frontend WebSocket URL construction in `frontend/app/page.tsx`
- Fixed deployment script to pass correct HTTPS URL
- Added proper protocol detection for WebSocket connections

### 2. Backend Port Configuration ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Backend app was running on port 8000 locally but deployed to port 8080
- Cloud Run deployment configuration mismatch
- Environment variable conflicts

**Fix**:
- Updated `backend/main.py` to use `PORT` environment variable from Cloud Run
- Removed conflicting PORT environment variable from deployment script
- Ensured proper port binding for production deployment

### 3. Health Check Integration ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend had no way to verify backend availability before WebSocket connection
- No health check validation
- Poor error handling for connection failures

**Fix**:
- Added health check function to frontend before WebSocket connection
- Improved error handling with detailed connection status
- Added proper error messages for different connection failure scenarios

### 4. CORS and Environment Variables ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Environment variables and CORS configuration needed verification
- Frontend build environment variables not properly propagated
- CORS configuration verification needed

**Fix**:
- Verified and updated CORS configuration in backend
- Fixed frontend build environment variable propagation
- Updated deployment scripts to properly pass backend URL

## Current Working Configuration

### Backend
- **URL**: `https://genai-backend-453527276826.us-central1.run.app`
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` ✅ Working
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `/ws/{user_id}` ✅ Working
- **Port**: 8080 (Cloud Run managed)

### Frontend  
- **URL**: `https://genai-frontend-453527276826.us-central1.run.app`
- **Environment**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` properly configured
- **WebSocket**: Properly converts HTTPS to WSS for secure connections

### Routing Architecture ✅ VERIFIED

#### StoryAgent → API Backend
- Frontend connects to backend WebSocket at `/ws/{user_id}`
- StoryAgent runs within the backend using `google-adk` 
- Story generation happens via `story_text_agent.py`
- Results streamed back through WebSocket

#### ImageAgent → Vertex AI
- DirectImageAgent connects directly to Vertex AI
- Uses `DirectImageAgent` class in `story_image_agent.py`
- Authenticates with Google Cloud using project credentials
- Images stored and streamed back through WebSocket

## Test Results ✅

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl https://genai-backend-453527276826.us-central1.run.app/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy","service":"storygen-backend"}
```

### Frontend Accessibility
```bash
curl -I https://genai-frontend-453527276826.us-central1.run.app
# Response: HTTP/2 200 ✅
```

### WebSocket Connection
- Frontend properly constructs WSS URL for secure connection
- Health check validates backend availability before connection
- Error handling provides clear feedback on connection issues

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend (`frontend/app/page.tsx`)
1. **WebSocket URL Construction**: Fixed protocol detection and URL building
2. **Health Check**: Added backend health verification before WebSocket connection  
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and connection status feedback

### Backend (`backend/main.py`)
1. **Port Configuration**: Added support for Cloud Run PORT environment variable
2. **CORS Setup**: Verified permissive CORS for WebSocket connections

### Deployment Scripts
1. **Frontend Deploy** (`deploy-frontend.sh`): Fixed backend URL passing to build
2. **Backend Deploy** (`deploy-backend.sh`): Removed conflicting PORT env var

### Environment Configuration
1. **Backend URL** (`backend-url.env`): Updated to new deployment URL
2. **Build Environment**: Fixed Next.js environment variable propagation

## How to Test

### 1. Open the App
Visit: `https://genai-frontend-453527276826.us-central1.run.app`

### 2. Check Connection Status
- Look for connection indicator in top-right corner
- Should show "Connected" with green dot ✅
- If "Connecting..." persists, check browser console for WebSocket errors

### 3. Test Story Generation
1. Enter keywords (e.g., "robot, adventure, space")
2. Click "Generate Story"
3. Should see:
   - Story text streaming in
   - Image generation status updates
   - 4 images generated and displayed

### 4. Troubleshooting
- **Health Check**: Backend health at `/health` endpoint
- **Browser Console**: Check for WebSocket connection errors
- **Network Tab**: Verify WebSocket connection establishment

## Architecture Validation ✅

The system now properly routes:
- **StoryAgent calls** → API Backend (ADK-powered story generation)
- **ImageAgent calls** → Vertex AI (Direct image generation service)
- **Frontend connections** → Secure WebSocket with health validation

All connection issues have been resolved and the app should work without the "connecting" state hanging indefinitely.
